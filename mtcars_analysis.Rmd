#Summary
This document contains an analysis of the mtcars dataset included in R.  In it, I seek to answer the following questions:

1.  Is an automatic or manual transmission better for mpg?
2.  Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

In short, it is easy to see that cars that manual cars get better MPG.  Why that is, however, is not so obvious.  We will explore that question further.

## MPG vs. Transmission Type
An initial boxplot showing mpg for both automatic and manual cars (Figure 1)

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message = F, warning = F, cache = TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(GGally)
data(mtcars)
